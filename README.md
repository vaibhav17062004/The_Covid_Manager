# The_Covid_Manager
The covid manager project was made in the difficult time of pandemic.
From this project we can order the necessities like medicine,oxygen cylinder,PPE kit etc. 
We can book beds,get your vaccination certificate,donate blood,and generate e pass.
We took our inspiration of this project from CoWin site and and learned new concepts of pyttsx 3, web browser module. I created this project for my cs final board practical with my colleagues.This project helped me getting full marks in my class XII cs board practical.
Therefore I am sharing the link to all the project files of The COVID manager.
And remember to download matplotlib,pyttsx,cv2 after that only the file will properly work.
